# Square Matrix (SquareMat)

An implementation of a square matrix class in C++ with complete operator overloading.

## Description

The `SquareMat` class provides a full implementation of a square matrix with a wide range of mathematical operations, including:
- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Matrix multiplication
- Element-wise multiplication
- Matrix power
- Determinant calculation
- Transposition
- Comparison operators
- Increment and decrement operators

## Project Structure

- `squaremat.hpp` - Header file containing the class definition
- `squaremat.cpp` - Class implementation
- `main.cpp` - Usage examples
- `Test.cpp` - Comprehensive unit tests
- `makefile` - For project compilation
- `doctest.h` - Testing library

## Requirements

- C++ compiler supporting C++17 standard or newer
- Make (optional, for use with the makefile)

## Compilation and Execution

To build the program:
```
make 
```

To run the usage example:
```
make Main
```

To run the tests:
```
make test
./Test
```
To run the valgrind:
```
make valgrind
```
